## Summary Objective

	This project promotes the skills to testing a website. Using the 
	Jasmine Behavior-Driven Development Framework, this project will
	create tests that will ensure the expected working functionalty.

	My project submission creates seven tests in total for a provided
	website that uses the Google Feeds API to retrieve four different
	RSS feeds.

## Note To Evaluator

	1) Replaced the 'Todo Instruction' comments with comments that would
	reflect professional code. They describe the test.

	2) Replaced the Spec matcher for TEST 6. The matcher accurately tests
	for 1 or more entries versus the total. This is a more precise test
	for the real world.
